Used the StateMachine example provided for us from class to create a daylight saveing time program
that increments one hour eveytime the clock() method is called from the stateContext class.
When the StandardTime class is called. the clock will stop and the clock will be set back one hour before resuming.
When the SavingTime class is called. the clock will stop and the clock will be set ahead one hour before resuming.
